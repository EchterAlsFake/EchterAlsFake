# EchterAlsFake / Johannes

**`Digital Craftsman | Content Creator | Developer | Student | Life Enjoyer | Caffeine Junky `**

üëã Hey there! I'm Johannes, a 17-year-old student living in Germany. My coding journey began at 12, and ever since, I've been constantly (more or less) pushing commits and working on various projects, although not on this account. 
My passion lies in developing graphical user interfaces with Python and web-scraping APIs, with all my projects being open-source under the (L)GPL License. üåê Although I'm not frequently active on my YouTube Channel [EchterAlsFake](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1cV2H2WKPYXb2AqBkyXj2Q), 
I'm planning to create videos, when I finally have the time (actually: No). I use Arch Linux (btw) as my daily system together with [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)

Apart from coding, I occasionally delve into Cybersecurity, expanding my knowledge and skills. üõ°Ô∏è

**What I Believe:**
- Collaboration is key to success, and I'm always open to it. Let's create something amazing together! ü§ù
- Positivity over saltiness any day! If you've got an issue, just open it up. We're all here to learn and grow. üòÑ
- Stand with Ukraine! üá∫üá¶
- FUCK AFD (AFD is a political party in Germany that basically consists of Nazis)
- EU > USA (Donald Trump and Elon Musk are the biggest Memes in history lmao)

## üéµ About my music taste
![My scrobbles](https://lastfm-recently-played.vercel.app/api?user=echteralsfake)

I'm a big fan of music, and here's a snapshot of my favorite artists and song. Music is the most important thing for me.
I am listening to all kinds of genres. From UK-Drill to sweet japanese music, german rap, Hip hop, russian hardbass, phonk, literally everything :)

I don't use any streaming service for music (anymore), but instead I use VLC media player to play my Hi-Res
media collection (100 GB lol). 

If you are interested in the specific songs, you can find the VlC Playlist file in this repository :)

<br>A: Yes (way too much)

Q: What does "EchterAlsFake" mean?
<br>A: Nothing. If you translate it to English, it would be something as "more real than fake" however, I came across this
name by waking up in the night and thinking: "Yes, that's my new username." Don't search for a sense there, it has none lol

Q: Can I add you on Discord and just write with you about stupid shit?
<br>A: Sure :) 


# Why I am sometimes inactive
As you can see from the commits, there are weeks when I literally code 8 hours straight, but then there are weeks or 
even months of inactivity. I still go to school. It's not as if I would learn for anything, but to get good grades without
learning I need to be very active in the lessons, and when I arrive home, I just don't have the energy left for coding.

Please remember that I do that Open-Source and in my free time. While I do my best to keep all projects functional, I cannot
guarantee for it. If I have one of those "very active" phases, I will set a üî• emoji on GitHub to indicate that.
