Here's a list of deleted repositories:

EchterAlsFake/wigle-extract

Wigle Extract was my first GUI tool made in PyQt5. It was able to search CSV files from Wigle for insecure wifi networks
based of on my personal wifi hacking experience.

This project is removed, because I don't see a good use case and since wigle doesn't export WPS and or manufacturer
information, the results are not very accurate.

EchterAlsFake/SuperRun

Super Run was supposed to be a 2D Game for a school project, but things went in a wrong direction and I don't want to
further explain this mess.
